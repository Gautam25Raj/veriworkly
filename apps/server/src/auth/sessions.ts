/**
 * Revoking a session means clearing it from THREE independent stores. Deleting the Postgres row
 * on its own does nothing observable, because better-auth is configured with `secondaryStorage`
 * and its `findSession` reads Redis first and returns without ever querying the database — so a
 * raw `prisma.session.deleteMany()` leaves the user fully authenticated until the Redis entry
 * expires on its own (`AUTH_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`, 30 days by default).
 *
 * The three stores:
 *   1. better-auth's session-by-token entry in Redis  -> internalAdapter.deleteSessions()
 *   2. better-auth's `active-sessions-<userId>` index  -> deleted here; note that the *plural*
 *      deleteSessions() does not prune it (only the singular deleteSession() does)
 *   3. this app's own `auth:session:<cookie-hash>` cache -> invalidateCacheByToken()
 *
 * A raw Prisma delete also bypasses better-auth's `databaseHooks.session.delete.after`, which is
 * what would otherwise have called invalidateCacheByToken for us. Always route session removal
 * through this module rather than deleting `session` rows directly.
 *
 * Not revocable: the `cookieCache` JWT held by the client (`AUTH_SESSION_CACHE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`,
 * 15 min). That is inherent to a stateless cookie cache — it bounds how fast any revocation can
 * take effect, so keep that TTL short.
