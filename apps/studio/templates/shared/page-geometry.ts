/**
 * The printed page box, shared by every document type.
 *
 * A4 at 96dpi is 793.71 x 1122.52 CSS px (595.28 x 841.89 pt). Resumes used to
 * floor the height to 1122 while cover letters ceiled it to 1123 — the same
 * physical page described by two different numbers, which meant a preview page
 * break could land differently between document types for no reason. One constant
 * now, floored, so the preview box can never be taller than the PDF page it
 * represents (a preview that is 1px too tall hides a sliver of content; one that is
 * 1px too short only breaks marginally early).
 *
 * PDF templates state the size in points via {@link pxToPt} rather than `size="A4"`,
 * so both sides derive from these same numbers.
