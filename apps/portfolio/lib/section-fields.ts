/**
 * What the portfolio editor lets a user fill in, per section type.
 *
 * Before this existed, `SectionEditor` rendered one fixed form for every
 * section — title, year, summary, and a project cover — while the templates
 * read 28 distinct item fields. A user could not set their employer, job
 * title, school, degree, credential issuer, dates, skills, keywords, or
 * language proficiency anywhere in the product, so those parts of every
 * template were unreachable and rendered blank on published portfolios.
 *
 * This map is the single source of truth for the editor form. Templates read
 * the same keys (via the normalizing accessors in `template-library/types.ts`),
 * so adding a field here makes it editable *and* published with no other
 * change.
 *
 * Keys are chosen to match what the templates already read. Where a template
 * historically accepted more than one name for the same idea (`description`
 * vs `summary`, `issuer` vs `organization`), the accessors resolve both and
 * the editor writes the canonical one listed here.
